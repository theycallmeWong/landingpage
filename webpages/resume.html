            <p>
                I am deeply passionate about web development, reading, and playing sports. In sports, I thrive in environments that require teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking, which I believe are qualities that also translate well into my technical work. Whether it's playing basketball, soccer, or even outdoor adventure sports, I approach each activity with a focus on continuous improvement, much like I do in my development projects. I believe my commitment to learning, paired with my team-oriented mindset, positions me as a strong candidate for this role. My passion for both technology and sports allows me to bring a balanced, determined approach to problem-solving and collaboration.

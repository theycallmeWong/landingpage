        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
            My childhood was a whirlwind of adventure and discovery in the heart of Quezon City. I remember waking up to the crowing of roosters and the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Our humble home was always filled with laughter, especially during family gatherings. My parents, both hardworking, my dad is a businessman, instilled in us the value of education. We weren't that rich, but we were rich in love and values. I spent countless hours playing ‘agawan base’ and ‘tumbang preso’ with my friends. My Lola used to tell me stories about her childhood experience, and I found them fascinating. My favorite activities were climbing trees and exploring the nearby creek. Those were my favorite adventures. Sometimes, I would catch birds like Maya and bring them home. My mom would always remind me to release them back. I was a curious and imaginative child. I loved to watch movies and play games when in my free time. My favorite subject was Mathematics and Science back then. I joined every basketball tryout back then. I wasn't always the winner, but I had fun joining. I also loved reading books. My favorite was the story of ‘Si Kuneho at si Pagong’. My childhood was simple but full of happy memories. It shaped me into the person I am today. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>
            My teenage years were a mix of excitement and awkwardness. High school was a whole new world. I was both thrilled and terrified. Suddenly, there were more subjects to study, more friends to make, and more challenges to face. I joined a drum and lyre group at school. Time goes by I discovered my passion for public speaking. I also tried out for the basketball team but was not selected. That was a bit heartbreaking, but I learned to accept rejection. I focused more on my studies. I was determined to get good grades. Siyempre, uso rin ang crush, I had my first crush in high school. Nakakakilig pero nakakahiya din minsan. There were school dances and ligawan moments. I remember my first slow dance. Sobrang kinakabahan ako. I also experienced heartbreaks. Hindi mawawala iyon sa teenage years. My teenage years were also a time of self-discovery. I started to understand myself better. I learned to embrace my strengths and weaknesses. I learned the importance of friendship. My friends were my support system. We would spend hours talking about everything and nothing. We would watch movies, go to the mall, and eat street food. Teenage life was a rollercoaster of emotions. But it was a necessary stage in my journey to adulthood. It prepared me for the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead. I learned to be more responsible and independent. I also learned the value of hard work and perseverance.

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <p>
            College life in the bustling city of Manila was a transformative experience. I took up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. It was a challenging but fulfilling course. I was fascinated by programming languages and coding. I learned about programming and software development, which involves learning languages like Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript, as well as understanding the software development life cycle and web development frameworks. College was not just about academics. It was also about personal growth. I became more independent and responsible. I learned to manage my time wisely. I met so many people and professors. I became active in community service. I joined ROTC when I was first year college for exposure. I've experienced so many, especially when it comes to discipline. I met people from all walks of life. I learned to appreciate diversity. I made lifelong friends. We studied together, laughed together, and cried together. College was also a time for exploration. I discovered new interests. I rediscovered my love for basketball. I also learned to appreciate different perspectives. I became more open-minded. College was a training ground for the real world.

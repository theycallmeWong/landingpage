                <p>I'm learning how to clean and show data by practicing data analysis using tools like Pandas and NumPy. Git is helping me get acquainted with version control, which facilitates project collaboration. Through personal projects and coding challenges, I'm honing my problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I'm aiming to strengthen my verbal and writing communication abilities because I think they're essential in any line of employment. I'm getting better at succinctly and simply describing technical ideas. I feel at ease using Linux and Windows, among other operating systems.</p>

            <div id="teenage-content" class="about-me">
                <p>My teenage years were a mix of excitement and awkwardness. High school was a whole new world. I was both thrilled and terrified. Suddenly, there were more subjects to study, more friends to make, and more challenges to face. I joined a drum and lyre group at school. Time goes by I discovered my passion for public speaking. I also tried out for the basketball team but was not selected. That was a bit heartbreaking, but I learned to accept rejection. I focused more on my studies. I was determined to get good grades. Siyempre, uso rin ang crush, I had my first crush in high school. Nakakakilig pero nakakahiya din minsan. There were school dances and ligawan moments. I remember my first slow dance. Sobrang kinakabahan ako. I also experienced heartbreaks. Hindi mawawala iyon sa teenage years. My teenage years were also a time of self-discovery. I started to understand myself better. I learned to embrace my strengths and weaknesses. I learned the importance of friendship. My friends were my support system. We would spend hours talking about everything and nothing. We would watch movies, go to the mall, and eat street food. Teenage life was a rollercoaster of emotions. But it was a necessary stage in my journey to adulthood. It prepared me for the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead. I learned to be more responsible and independent. I also learned the value of hard work and perseverance.</p>

College was not just about academics. It was also about personal growth. I became more independent and responsible. I learned to manage my time wisely. I met so many people and professors. I became active in community service. I joined ROTC when I was first year college for exposure. I've experienced so many, especially when it comes to discipline. I met people from all walks of life. I learned to appreciate diversity. I made lifelong friends. We studied together, laughed together, and cried together. College was also a time for exploration. I discovered new interests. I rediscovered my love for basketball. I also learned to appreciate different perspectives. I became more open-minded. College was a training ground for the real world. It taught me valuable lessons about life, love, and everything in between. I faced challenges and overcame them. I learned from my mistakes. That was one of my proudest moments.
